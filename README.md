# tide-examples
Super simple example scripts to print out or download tide times using NIWA's Tide API (https://tides.niwa.co.nz)

You can also use the API through Siri Shortcuts. This example reads out the previous and next tide times for the nearest sea location (you must grant it location access when it runs)

All examples require an API key with access to the Tides API, which can be created at developer.niwa.co.nz
